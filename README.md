# 4111-proj1 Part 3

Okay, so the layout for all the HTML files are taken care of. It's basic as 
hell, but it will get the job done. Also, just for cleanliness, I added two 
files into the static folder: index.css and intro.js. I've added the CSS all to
the static file and put the import statement into the index.html file. This 
just makes each subsequent HTML file a lot cleaner. I have not added JS yet, 
as things could probably stay pretty basic right now. 

The next step that I need to take is to connect to the DBMS and display the 
results from the database. Once I figure out how I do that, then I will 
go ahead and start adding the process of adding user data to the tables 


Kate: 
-Login on the home page that will redirect the user to their profile and print out their information.
-If they are not in the database when you click login it just stays on the homepage.
-If they are not logged in and they click the Profile tab, it will keep them at the homepage until they login.
-New user form to add users to the database. If you try to add a user with the same a repeated user name
it just redirects to the homepage again. 
-Search bar allows user to search for recipes by ingredients. Displaying recipe information on search.html
-Once logged in, user has the option to log out or delete their account.
