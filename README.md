# 4111-proj1 Part 3
Kate: 
Made a login on the home page that will redirect the user to their profile and print out their information.
If they are not in the database when you click login it just stays on the homepage
If they are not logged in and they click the Profile tab, it will keep them at the homepage until they login.
Added a new user form to add users to the database. If you try to add a user with the same a repeated user name
it just redirects to the homepage again. 

Sould probably add error messages on the screen but that is a later problem, right now everything above works.  

To do / look into on Sunday:
    Need to make delete button in Profile
    The favorites automatically populates for a new user? I added a user and they already have 2 favorites, not sure how or why.
    As soon as we can get recipes printed we can easily make a favorite button. 
    search bar - I have a youtube video saved to follow for this


I made the Chef names into a clickable link but haven't messed with anything that happens after that yet. Same with recipes.
I've spent so long trying to figure out how to make a new page pop up full of a single recipes info and can't figure it out.



Chris:
I have spent far too long working on a redirect and I need a new approach. It seems after looking through multiple 
resources, I should look at changing the redirects from a clickable link to a form. I'm going to try and add a 
button to each database row that allows the user to click and hopefully to a new HTML page. After that, to display
a user profile page, I will most likely just add a search box where the user will just have to type in the name
of the profile they would like to visit. Hopefully using forms will make it easier. 

-For this push, I am going to merge with main to establish a point where I can pull from if I need to start over
