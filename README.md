# 4111-proj1 Part 3

Okay, so the layout for all the HTML files are taken care of. It's basic as 
hell, but it will get the job done. Also, just for cleanliness, I added two 
files into the static folder: index.css and intro.js. I've added the CSS all to
the static file and put the import statement into the index.html file. This 
just makes each subsequent HTML file a lot cleaner. I have not added JS yet, 
as things could probably stay pretty basic right now. 

The next step that I need to take is to connect to the DBMS and display the 
results from the database. Once I figure out how I do that, then I will 
go ahead and start adding the process of adding user data to the tables 


Kate: 
Made a login on the home page that will redirect the user to their profile and print out their information.
If they are not logged in and they click Profile tab, it will keep them at the homepage until they login.
Right now I think anyone can "login", if you try it without a user in our database it still brings you to their Profile
and no information is there, so I need to work on that error.

Then it has a new user form to add users to the database (no errors but I'm not sure if its actually adding someone to the database yet)
I made the Chef names into a clickable link but haven't messed with what happens after that yet.
Committing now just to have an updated version of everything but I'm going to keep working!
