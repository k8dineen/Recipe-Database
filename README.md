Created a recipe database using SQL to incorporate tables: Users, Chefs, Recipes, Cuisines, Ingredients.
Using Flask and python, I created a website to manage this database and explore. 

Within the website, users can create profiles or login if they have an existing profile. They will have their personalized profile page where they can view any recipes they create and have the option to delete them from the database. Within the recipes tab, users can select any recipes to the get the ingredients and direction, comment, or save the recipe to their favorites. Using the search bar on the navigation tab, users can search recipes by any ingredient. After they are done, users can navigate back to their profile page and logout or delete their account for good, deleting on cascade all of their recipes or comments.
