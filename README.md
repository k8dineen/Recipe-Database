# 4111-proj1 Part 3

Okay, so the layout for all the HTML files are taken care of. It's basic as 
hell, but it will get the job done. Also, just for cleanliness, I added two 
files into the static folder: index.css and intro.js. I've added the CSS all to
the static file and put the import statement into the index.html file. This 
just makes each subsequent HTML file a lot cleaner. I have not added JS yet, 
as things could probably stay pretty basic right now. 

The next step that I need to take is to connect to the DBMS and display the 
results from the database. Once I figure out how I do that, then I will 
go ahead and start adding the process of adding user data to the tables 


Kate: 
I set up a form on Profiles that officially adds a user to the database, or at least so I think right now, no errors. Still working on trying to redirect the page to their profile after so they get add and delete things. Breaking to go home and pick it up a little later!
